<h1>CSS</h1>
  Adjacent sibling selectors let us style an element only if preceded by a specific element. We do so using the + operator:
<p>
  Example:

  p + span {
    color: yellow;
  }
</p>
  This will assign the color yellow to all span elements preceded by a p element:

  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  <span>This is a yellow span</span>
  We have a lot more selectors we can use:
  <p>
  <oi>
    <li>attribute selectors</li>
    <li>pseudo class selectors</li>
    <li>pseudo element selectors</li>
  We’ll find all about them in the next sections.
</oi>

  CASCADE
  <strong><u>Cascade</u> is a fundamental concept of CSS</strong>. After all, it’s in the name itself, the first C of CSS — Cascading Style Sheets — it must be an important thing.
  <br>
  What does it mean?
  <p>
  Cascade is the process, or algorithm, that determines the properties applied to each element on the page. Trying to converge from a list of CSS rules that are defined in various places.


  It does so taking in consideration:
</p>  <p>
  specificity
  importance
  inheritance
  order in the file
  It also takes care of resolving conflicts.
</p>
  Two or more competing <strong><u>CSS</u></strong> rules for the same property applied to the same element need to be elaborated according to the CSS spec, to determine which one needs to be applied.

  Even if you just have one <strong><u>CSS</u></strong> file loaded by your page, there is other CSS that is going to be part of the process. We have the browser (user agent) CSS. Browsers come with a default set of rules, all different between browsers.

  Then your CSS comes into play.

  Then the browser applies any user stylesheet, which might also be applied by browser extensions.
